I have completed the course "Deep Learning and Neural Networks" from Coursera. 
I have attached the certificate in this folder. 
This course focuses on the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.

Chapter1: Introduction to Deep Learning
Analyze the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and give examples of where and how it is applied today.

Chapter2: Neural Networks Basics
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

Chapter3: Shallow Neural Networks
Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

Chapter4: Deep Neural Networks
Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.
